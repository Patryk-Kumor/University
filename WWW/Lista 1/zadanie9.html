			When Mr. Bilbo Baggins of Bag End announced that he would shortly be 
			celebrating his eleventy -first birthday with a party of special 
			magnificence, there was much talk and excitement in Hobbiton. 
			<br> <br>
			Bilbo was very rich and very peculiar, and had been the wonder of the 
			Shire for sixty years, ever since his remarkable disappearance and 
			unexpected return. The riches he had brought back from his travels had now 
			become a local legend, and it was popularly believed, whatever the old folk 
			might say, that the Hill at Bag End was full of tunnels stuffed with 
			treasure. And if that was not enough for fame, there was also his prolonged 
			vigour to marvel at. Time wore on, but it seemed to have little effect on 
			Mr. Baggins. At ninety he was much the same as at fifty. At ninety-nine they 
			began to call him we//-preserved, but unchanged would have been nearer the 
			mark. There were some that shook their heads and thought this was too much 
			of a good thing; it seemed unfair that anyone should possess (apparently) 
			perpetual youth as well as (reputedly) inexhaustible wealth.
